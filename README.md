# Contextora AI — Intelligent Web3 Agent Factory

**Contextora** is an AI Agent Factory built on Ethereum, powered by **OpenContext MCP** — a secure, modular protocol enabling natural language interaction between Large Language Models (LLMs) and decentralized applications via MetaMask.

> "Blockchain should be as simple as saying: ‘Send 50 USDC to my Polygon wallet.’ Contextora makes that happen."
